🌌 Lorenz Attractor — MATLAB Visualization & Animation
This project visualizes the Lorenz Attractor, a famous chaotic system that arises from simplified models of atmospheric convection.
It demonstrates nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, sensitivity to initial conditions, and modern scientific visualization techniques.

📌 What Is the Lorenz System?
The Lorenz system is a set of three coupled nonlinear differential equations:
x˙=σy-x
y˙=x(ρ-z)-y
z˙=xy-βz
